# What’s risk?

the uncertainty that will happen in future (the likelihood of bad outcome). People need to be paid to accept risk. activities that normally do with the risk are reducing risk, eliminating risk and pricing risk.

## Reducing risk through diversification

Risk that you can do nothing about is BETA risk. BETA measures the market-wide risk that cannot be eliminated through diversification because it happens to everybody. it needs to be priced.

Beta = Co- variance (company’s returns and market returns)/ variance in the market returns

cash has 0 Beta.

Risk- free rate, the return an investor would expect from an absolutely risk- free investment over a specific period of time. For a given level of risk, how much return, over and above the risk- free rate, would an investor require? benchmark and starting line.

Risk- free rate = Expected inflation + The time value of money

Equity Investment, an investment in the shares of a company. It is more risky than the risk- free investment, so we have equity risk premium get involved. Equity risk premium, the extra amount you expected to earn on your investment because you are investing in risky assets. For example, Stock investment = 11 percent per year - Risk- free investment = 5 percent, Equity risk premium = 6 percent. 

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

Risk- free rate + (Equity risk premium x Beta)= Expected Return, return on investment should be greater than the risk- free rate plus an equity risk premium.
