<p>Settlement time is <strong>April 2022</strong> and the worst is we only have a chance of 10% becoming the Australian permanent resident before that time. Okay, let&rsquo;s calculate the cost that we need to pay to own the property by investment way.</p>
<h2 id=the-equation>The equation</h2>
<p>Purchase Price $746K+ 5% cost $37,300+ 3% Additional Foreign Acquirer Duty $22,380= $805,680 fund required- deposit already paid $74,600=$ 731,080 shortfall.
Where should we get the shortfall from?
The obvious answer always is from our own savings and bank lending. Here, we look first at how much loan we can get from the bank to minimize the out of pocket money. The most lending we can have is $ 668,159 (88% of purchase price $656,500+ 1.58% of purchase price mortgage insurance $11,659).</p>
<h2 id=the-lending>The lending</h2>
<p>We have a strong salary income as a family and all in AUD. We are acceptable to the big 4 banks even we don&rsquo;t hold the PR visa. The shame is I cannot take any benefit of the employee special offer( which includes the annual package fee to be waived, the max lending with 90% without paying mortgage insurance etc.) Finally, I will select the Flexi First Option Investment Loan with Principal & Interest repayment type, it has no annual fee, monthly fee and establishment fee. As Chong and I decide that we rent out the property till the end of 2022, and then refinance it as the owner-occupied property for ourselves to move into in Jan 2023.</p>
<h3 id=serviceability>Serviceability</h3>
<p>Let me calculate our serviceability. Given we can only lend 90% of the property contract value, including the mortgage insurance. The end service is passed and the service is strong. So, great job!
###Negative Gearing
It is a commonly used term used to describe a situation where expenses associated with an asset (including interest expenses) are greater than the income earned from the asset. Negative gearing can apply to any type of investment, not just housing. In our situation, NG is not necessarily to be used for servicing the loan, but it is still worth having a look at.</p>
<p>Individuals who are negatively geared can deduct their loss against other income, such as salary and wages. This is consistent with the broader operation of Australia’s personal income tax system- Quoted from the Treasury Website.</p>
<p>So what shares Chong and I have between the investment property can max our negative gearing benefit? We can find in the calculator there is no difference among how many shares we each have impacting the NG as below table.</p>

<p>##The out of pocket money</p>
<p>Based on above calculation, the out of pocket savings = $731,080 shortfall- $656,500 new loan= $74,580. Please note we don&rsquo;t include Mortgage Insurance in as we know it will be capitalised and added to the total loan amount.</p>
<h2 id=conclution>Conclution</h2>
<p>To max the benefit we can to buy an Australian investment property, we need to settle it with $ 74,850 savings and rent it out to be eligible for the tax deduction. Australian Property price is rising during the past 2 years, we sooner or later will be part of the market, why wait and see the uptrend with no action?</p>
